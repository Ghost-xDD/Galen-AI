## Features
- Creators can generate Images using Stable Diffusion _(we plan to add other ai models later_)
- Creators can set a MaxSupply and price on their created images and prompts.
- The Prompt used to generate the Images are token-gated, so only users who buy the NFT can get access to the prompt.
- The User can generate a secondary unique new image using the prompt and also list on the marketplace.
- The secondary NFT Image prompt is a derivative NFT of the original prompt, and is linked to the tokenID of the original prompt.
- NOTE: Should the original creator choose to set a royalty amount on their created prompt, it will be deducted from every sale made by the secondary prompt. This ensures that both creators continually get paid for their work
