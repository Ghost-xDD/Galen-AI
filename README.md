## Galen AI

Galen AI is an innovative AI prompt marketplace built on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Promptbase and PromptHero, Galen AI takes a step further by allowing users to not only generate images using AI models but also convert these images into NFTs.

### Features
- AI-Powered Image Generation: Utilize cutting-edge AI models like Stable Diffusion and DALLÂ·E to transform text prompts into captivating images.

- NFT Creation: Once you're satisfied with the generated image, seamlessly convert it into an NFT. Add essential metadata such as the name, description, and the original prompt used for image generation. You can also specify other parameters like the maximum supply and price of the NFT.

- Tokengated Prompts: In a unique twist, the prompts used for generating images are tokengated. This means only users who purchase the NFT can access the original prompt. This allows them to generate secondary images using the exclusive prompt they've acquired.

- Smart Contract Integration: While the UI integration is still in progress, the underlying smart contract for the marketplace has been successfully deployed. The demo version allows users to buy NFTs directly from the smart contract.

- OpenSea API Integration: Galen AI leverages the OpenSea API to fetch all NFT data from the Avalanche testnet. This integration also facilitates the tokengating of prompts.
